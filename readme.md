# Multi-level annotation of the Rigveda

This repository contains a verb-argument annotation of the complete Rigveda as well as its morpho-lexical analysis.
Data were created in three steps:
* H. Hettrich (Würzburg University) created the verb-argument annotation.
* O. Hellwig (Düsseldorf University) created the morpho-lexical annotation. - Verb-argument and morpho-lexical annotation were performed independent of each other.
* Data sources were merged in a project located at the Department of Computational Linguistics (Saarbrücken) under the guidance of M. Pinkal and partly funded by the Cluster of Excellence “Multimodal Computing and Interaction” of German Science Foundation (DFG).

More details about the annotation process and the structure of the data can be found in the following publication:
